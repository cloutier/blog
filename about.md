When I was 5, I started asking a lot of questions about everything. After a few years, my parents were underwhelmed by the sheer quantity of questions, and they showed me how seek answers with computers.

After being armed with those self-learning capabilities, I went on to learn how to make websites, animated movies, a bit of AI with TensorFlow among other thing. I slightly prefer backend development, but I will be very happy to help you fix hard problems.
